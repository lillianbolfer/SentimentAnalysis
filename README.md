We are going to use sentiment analysis to analyze tweets on twitter, in regard to a major media event (Netflix before, the day of, and after the annoucement that they're pulling The Office – wide audience, less Russian trolls, and while headache-y at least not completely sanity destroying). We will use a combination of Tweepy and a selection of other Python packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) along with TextBlob in order to analyze viewers’ verbal sentiments and intentions in regards to specific awards. By filtering down based on hash tags and key words in relation to netflix, we will look at based on the results how did the public respond?

We will use classification to do this, but also visualize trends with a visual interface – methodology to be decided, but visualization after analysis and categorization will use it to upload to Tableau for instance and showcase charts on a colored scale to indicate positivity vs. negativity.
