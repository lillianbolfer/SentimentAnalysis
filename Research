About TextBlob

TextBlob is a NLP (Natural Language Processor) that is used in Machine Learning to help computers understand a human's natural language.
The goal of using an NLP is to read, process, understand, and portray language in a way that is useful to us. NLP is extremely 
useful in a variety of technologies, here are a few examples:
-Google Translate
-Word Processors
-Siri/Alexa (Voice command prompts)

It is difficult for a computer to process and understand a humans natural language. So how is this accomplished? NLP uses
algorithms to identify a word's sytax and semantics to properly identify it.

TextBlob in particular is a Python Library, which makes it ideal for use in our project. It offers a simple API to access its
capabilities and it converts the results to strings. This makes it easy to manipulate the data through simple python commands.
